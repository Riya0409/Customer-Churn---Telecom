This project explores telecom customer data to understand usage behavior, network patterns, and churn risk. Using Python-based EDA and machine learning techniques, the notebook uncovers insights that telecom operators can use for customer retention, service optimization, and targeted marketing.

The workflow includes:

Importing and cleaning telecom customer datasets

Exploratory data analysis of call usage, data consumption, recharge behavior, and customer demographics

Identifying patterns linked to churn and non-churn users

Building predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to classify customers at risk of churn

Visualizing important KPIs such as ARPU trends, call vs data usage, service complaints, and retention indicators

The notebook serves as a practical template for telecom analytics, customer churn prediction, and data-driven decision-making in the telecommunications domain.
